# Protocol Overview

Furcate is a distributed machine learning protocol that enables AI on edge devices without centralizing data or requiring hardware upgrades.

## Core Concepts

### Federated Learning
Models train locally on device data, only encrypted updates are shared.

### Ensemble Methods
Multiple models combine predictions for improved accuracy.

### Proof of Authority
Consensus among verified devices without mining.

### Cryptographic Attestation
Hardware-backed proof of secure execution.

## Architecture

See [Protocol Specification](https://github.com/furcateresearch/furcate-protocol) for technical details.
